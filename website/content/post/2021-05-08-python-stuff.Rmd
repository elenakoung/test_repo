```{r }
library(reticulate)
rtalk <- "this is R :)"

```
{python} import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

```{python}
ptalk = "this is Python >:)"
print(r.rtalk,ptalk)

```

And this shows that R does the same thing, so the message is the same.

```{r }
cat(c(rtalk,py$ptalk))
```

```{python}

for i in range(3):
  print("I love stats!!")

```
